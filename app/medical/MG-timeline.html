<p>The Howard University (HU) SBIRT Medical Residency Program completed several activities as of the site visit date: created a manual of standard operating procedures that documents SBIRT background information, procedures, and requirements; implemented a cutting-edge standardized patient training facility where the residents perform SBIRT clinical skills examinations, receive written documentation of their performance, view a video recording of their patient encounter, and receive immediate feedback from the standardized patient; and developed an integrated curriculum that includes both didactic and experiential learning components (including lecture, practice session, online modules, five documented patient encounters, and a clinical skills examination). </p>

<p>By year 3 of its 5-year grant, the Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) School of Medicine medical residency training program had completed multiple program activities: developed a core curriculum using the brief negotiated interview model that has been implemented in the family medicine, internal medicine, and preventive medicine residency programs; developed evaluation tools to assess SBIRT training and clinic implementation; developed a plethora of training tools, including laminated pocket cards, role plays, and billing guides; developed and launched a Web site (<a href="http://www.sbirtoregon.org)" target="_blank">www.sbirtoregon.org)</a> that features the full curriculum, training videos, screening instruments, and resources; adopted a systems approach to SBIRT training; built capacity within practice sites before having residents begin practicing SBIRT; and organized its practice sites as patient-centered medical homes.</p>
