    <h3 class="accordion-header">PROGRAM VISION AND DESIGN</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Success Factors</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantees generally have clear goals and objectives.</li>
            <li>Grantee organizations and institutions generally view SBIRT as an important part of core skills to be learned by their students. The SBIRT model fits philosophically within their departments as a strengths-based approach to working with clients and patients.</li>
            <li>Grantees have obtained buy-in from multiple participating academic disciplines.</li>
            <li>Grantees seek to increase future SBIRT medical system capacity by growing the number of students and licensed professionals introduced to or trained in SBIRT.</li>
            <li>Grantees generally envision that trainees will promote and disseminate SBIRT practices in health care and social service settings throughout their State and local health care communities.</li>
            <li>Students trained through this grant are becoming positioned to become SBIRT practitioners and advocates. Grantees are developing “SBIRT-ready” students who will be able to support systemic implementation.</li>
            <li>Grantee projects are integrating the SAMHSA core curriculum into Web-based training, didactic courses, and hands-on skills-building through role-play, supervised clinical practice, and interprofessional training.</li>
            <li>With input from faculty and administrative staff from various disciplines, grantees have tailored curriculum content, including case studies and simulation activities, to account for practice considerations specific to their disciplines, States, and local areas.</li>
            <li>Many programs have shown sensitivity to cross-cultural and translation issues, using community and partner input regarding approaches and materials.</li>
            <li>At least one grantee program has been designated by its State Office of Alcohol and Substance Abuse Services as an accredited education and training provider for undergraduates wishing to obtain credentialing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>One grantee is concerned about whether the SBIRT training fits within the various programs’ philosophies, missions, and existing curricula.</li>
            <li>The large number of implementation sites poses a challenge for grantees because so many preceptors and field instructors throughout the systems need to be trained.</li>
            <li>One grantee has developed a 19-module curriculum that seems overwhelming to some site coordinators and faculty.</li>
            <li>One grantee’s curriculum is not standardized for any of the departments, and the grantee has not solidified plans for training beyond didactic lectures.</li>
            <li>While weaving SBIRT elements throughout a curriculum could be a strength, it also poses challenges, such as lack of a cohesive and holistic view of SBIRT.</li>
            <li>One grantee’s plans are not well established for training faculty, field supervisors, and other community partners who will be involved in administering and modeling the SBIRT training with students, residents, and professionals in the community.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">GRANTEE LEADERSHIP</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Success Factors</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Leadership and team members are generally highly experienced, dedicated, and competent scholars, educators, and practitioners who are committed to incorporating SBIRT into their programs and appreciate the critical importance of the training’s experiential component.</li>
            <li>Programs are generally composed of directors and university faculty from each targeted discipline (such as medicine, nursing, and social work) who are committed to building capacity within their departments or schools to give students an opportunity to learn about substance use and SBIRT.</li>
            <li>Staff are engaged in a continuous improvement process and are open to making changes to their training and implementation approach.</li>
            <li>Several programs have staff from previous and currently funded SAMHSA SBIRT grants.</li>
            <li>Most programs’ organizational structures are functionally designed to attain targeted goals.</li>
            <li>At least one program has members from its State Policy Steering Committee involved with its grant.</li>
            <li>The majority of grantees have formed a council of directors (COD) that is diverse, dedicated to the project, and includes leadership from participating disciplines and partners who are invested in their respective projects’ success.</li>
            <li>Some grantees are continuing to expand their CODs, both within and outside of their organizations or institutions.</li>
            <li>CODs have focused on varying areas: hiring staff; reviewing applications from students interested in the SBIRT training for State certification; assisting with community partners; monitoring students in implementing the SBIRT field component; discussing and resolving program challenges; facilitating trainees’ ability to perform SBIRT in their field placements; evaluating trainees’ use of SBIRT; tracking the use of SBIRT with patients; developing recruitment and marketing materials; and planning for program sustainability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Two grantees have a project director or project coordinator dedicated to the project for only 20 percent or less of their time.</li>
            <li>Faculty members from the different schools within one grantee institution appear to be at varying levels of knowledge, readiness, and buy-in regarding SBIRT.</li>
            <li>One program has not formed a functional COD.</li>
            <li>One program has limited buy-in from some COD members.</li>
            <li>The CODs at three programs are composed mainly of internal staff directly involved in the project.</li>
            <li>Infrequent COD meetings by some programs pose potential challenges in communicating and obtaining feedback on process and content improvements.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">IMPLEMENTATION PLAN</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Success Factors</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantees are at varying stages of meeting their program implementation goals in several areas: developing their projects’ organizational structure; developing training materials; cultivating linkages and partnerships; training faculty and other trainers, preceptors, and field instructors; training students and medical residents; collecting evaluation data; and submitting GPRA data.</li>
            <li>SBIRT training curricula are fully or partially implemented at the programs and incorporate multiple learning strategies:
                <ul>
                    <li>Some grantees have their curricula fully implemented in all disciplines.</li>
                    <li>One grantee has developed a three-module curriculum, to be disseminated across disciplines, currently being rolled out to nursing and rehabilitation counseling students.</li>
                    <li>Another grantee has integrated its SBIRT curriculum into required courses and training experiences for three of its four participating disciplines. That project plans to use a “plan, do, study, act” quality control model to temporarily implement any change and assess its impact, throughout the grant cycle.</li>
                    <li>One project is using an interdisciplinary training approach in which all specialties are trained at the same time in the same setting.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Faculty and preceptor training is thorough at most grantee programs.</li>
            <li>Grantees have adopted many strategies to support trainee practice within clinical settings, including use of preceptors and champions. They have worked hard to promote SBIRT and get buy-in from faculty and staff within their universities and practice sites. Some have teams of onsite program trainers who are also SBIRT champions. For example, one program has three trainers—all program champions—at a partner hospital: the director of the pediatric residency training program, a preceptor, and an embedded social worker who is adjunct faculty at the grantee college.</li>
            <li>Many grantee project staff have longstanding relationships with community preceptors.</li>
            <li>Many grantee programs have strong partnerships within local and State hospitals and community-based organizations.</li>
            <li>Training sites are varied throughout many grantee programs’ States and local areas.</li>
            <li>Many students have begun using SBIRT in their field placements. Some record their use of SBIRT with clients and patients and submit tracking sheets to faculty or field instructors for review and comment.</li>
            <li>At least one grantee is building on previous success as a SAMHSA Medical Residency grantee and has institutional knowledge, existing relationships, and existing training materials that have assisted in a successful startup.</li>
            <li>Grantees often incorporate skills-focused role-play scenarios into their SBIRT training, tailoring them to specific specialty areas, including behavioral health, child and family, gerontology, and nursing. At least one grantee uses its university’s simulation center to provide students and residents with immersive, high-fidelity, culturally appropriate simulation experiences.</li>
            <li>Some programs have integrated SBIRT into the electronic health records of their implementation sites.</li>
            <li>Some grantees have incorporated their SBIRT programs into certification programs, including a trauma certificate program and a Certified Alcohol and Drug Counselor program.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some grantees are encountering issues with their curricula or training materials:
                <ul>
                    <li>The curriculum is still being developed at a few grantee programs.</li>
                    <li>Faculty and students at one program noted the curriculum is dense, with too much information presented in the allotted training time.</li>
                    <li>One grantee describes its nursing students as needing more nurse-centered SBIRT materials.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Training is not yet underway at two grantee programs.</li>
            <li>Several grantees described challenges with their experiential components:
                <ul>
                    <li>Plans for implementing the experiential component in some disciplines have not been fully developed at a few programs. Some disciplines are planning to implement this component online—thus, students might not fully appreciate the experience of implementing SBIRT with patients in practice settings.</li>
                    <li>For one grantee, field placement agencies have been resistant to SBIRT out of concern that patients identified for brief intervention or treatment might be incarcerated, lose custody of their children, or lose benefits such as public housing.</li>
                    <li>One program has limited opportunities for direct observation and feedback for trainees.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Training of trainers is an issue for several grantees:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Some grantees are encountering issues with faculty buy-in at implementation sites, resulting in not enough faculty being trained.</li>
                <li>Fewer than half of the field instructors have received SBIRT training at one program.</li>
                <li>At one program, grantee staff and some faculty received introductory training on SBIRT and a curriculum overview, but a more comprehensive training is needed to make them confident in their ability to deliver and teach the SBIRT intervention.</li>
                <li>Finding enough qualified clinical preceptors and field instructors is a challenge for one program.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The variations in sites (such as size and educational environment) present evaluation and implementation challenges to some grantees. One grantee program’s eight sites vary in their engagement with the project and experience in topics such as substance use and e-learning. Similarly, another grantee is finding it difficult to combine training for nursing and social work students. Yet another grantee is encountering several challenges because its social work and nursing field placement sites operate differently than its medical residency programs:
                <ul>
                    <li>The field placements are greater in number and operate in a larger geographic area.</li>
                    <li>Coordination and communication of expectations between the schools and multiple field placements is challenging.</li>
                    <li>They must establish a uniform protocol to measure and document proficiency with the SBIRT intervention.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h3 class="accordion-header">COMMUNITY LINKAGES, PARTNERS, AND PARTICIPATION</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Success Factors</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantee programs have developed partnerships with a diverse and engaged group of educational institutions and are collaborating with highly experienced community partners to reach professionals throughout their States’ health care delivery system.</li>
            <li>Grantees have established working relationships with hospitals, clinical agencies, behavioral health referral networks, service providers, and outreach providers in their communities. These entities often serve as field placements for students in various programs. Their staff, including directors, are often trainers and SBIRT champions.</li>
            <li>Grantees and their partners have extensive ties to key institutions and organizations statewide and nationally. Many have established good working relationships with State government entities, local health care systems, and community organizations that train health care professionals throughout their States.</li>
            <li>Directors of city or State agencies and of large local substance abuse/heath care organizations serve on some grantees’ council of directors.</li>
            <li>One grantee has a community agency team responsible for cultivating relationships with field practice sites to encourage opportunities for social work students to use SBIRT in their internships at agencies where they will be placed for the academic year.</li>
            <li>One grantee is part of an SBIRT nursing consortium that could provide support and spark innovative ideas; another grantee is part of an independent group that includes, among others, another SBIRT grantee in the area. That group is attempting to build a community of practice around SBIRT and nursing.</li>
            <li>Some grantee programs stress sensitivity to cross-cultural and translation issues. For example, they solicit community and partner input to approaches and materials.</li>
            <li>One grantee plans to host a large SBIRT conference in fall 2014 that will highlight the program and involve community members. That grantee has proposed an interactive site through which the community can access SBIRT information. Another grantee is planning five community-based trainings and a regional training to further disseminate SBIRT throughout the State.</li>
            <li>One grantee holds an annual dinner for community partners to help strengthen relationships.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>One grantee is just beginning to identify community partners for SBIRT dissemination.</li>
            <li>One grantee program is for nurses only. While nurses are an important trainee group, that grantee must take steps to avoid becoming insular.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Success Factors</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantees are dedicated to providing an experiential learning experience for students, who will have an opportunity to practice SBIRT skills in the classroom and beyond.</li>
            <li>Grantees have created strong practicum programs. Some grantees’ practice sites are models of experiential learning, where SBIRT is part of their routine service provision.</li>
            <li>One grantee has an extensive experiential learning program within the institution in which all students and faculty have access to standardized patients.</li>
            <li>Some grantees will use teleconferences to facilitate training throughout the State.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Several grantees find it challenging to train preceptors, get buy-in from preceptors, and encourage clinical practice sites to implement SBIRT.</li>
            <li>One grantee has concerns about social work and nursing trainees getting the appropriate opportunity to practice SBIRT skills in field placements.</li>
            <li>Multiple practice site locations present a particular challenge for trainee experiential learning at one grantee program. Many of its sites do not have in-house clinics and therefore have little control over the preceptors. One of its sites is a university where all the learning is virtual, students and preceptors are spread across the country, and staff have little to no interaction with them.</li>
            <li>Similarly, another grantee has clinical practica taking place in a wide range of institutions, most of which do not implement SBIRT. That program has little control over the preceptors, and it will be challenging to motivate them to embrace SBIRT.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">AFFORDABLE CARE ACT READINESS</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Success Factors</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantees are training the next generation of the health care workforce in the skills and practices necessary to successfully adapt to the changing health care delivery system.</li>
            <li>Trainees will learn and work within a health care delivery system that is aligning operations with the newest models of care.</li>
            <li>The grantees’ multidisciplinary approaches position them well for expanding the workforce and providing a wraparound approach to health care in accordance with Affordable Care Act tenets and State needs.</li>
            <li>Grantee programs are seeking to license professionals in placement settings to create a ready pipeline for graduates who work in these settings to bill for SBIRT services. Many are training to build capacity for certified SBIRT professionals who can bill Medicaid and private payers for services.</li>
            <li>Grantees’ existing partnership with other health agencies, along with the rollout of their SBIRT implementation plans, will generate SBIRT-ready medical professionals and facilitate health insurance and Medicaid reimbursements for substance use disorders and related treatment services.</li>
            <li>At some grantee programs, SBIRT services delivered by licensed professionals, including ancillary staff, are billable under Medicaid and private insurers, if supervised by an SBIRT-trained licensed physician or other similarly trained, licensed health care provider.</li>
            <li>Grantees are filling a gap in nursing education by training students to integrate behavioral health prevention activities in medical settings.</li>
            <li>Grantees are working to integrate SBIRT within their partners’ and practice sites’ electronic health record systems.</li>
            <li>Some grantees are addressing billing and coding for SBIRT.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Challenge</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Although SBIRT is being integrated into one grantee’s electronic medical record, there are currently two different systems that do not interface.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">SUSTAINABILITY PLANNING</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Success Factors</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantees are working toward integrating SBIRT content into their existing curricula. By permanently embedding SBIRT content within required courses, at both bachelor’s and master’s levels, grantees are standardizing SBIRT content across disciplines and facilitating sustainability.</li>
            <li>Grantees have modified content and materials, including modules and scenarios for role-plays, to be relevant to programs with different focuses.</li>
            <li>Some grantees have developed specific course content in collaboration with champions and course instructors to promote buy-in, ownership, and sustainability.</li>
            <li>Grantees are grooming champions across disciplines. They have obtained buy-in and commitment from various individuals and entities: professors, clinical faculty, deans and other high-level university administrators, directors of participating specialty area schools, allied health professional programs, and community partner organizations.</li>
            <li>Some grantees have established strong partnerships with State government entities and community organizations that train health care professionals statewide. Maintaining support from these partners will help ensure ongoing commitment and sustainability of the program after grant funding ends.</li>
            <li>Councils of directors (CODs) will support sustainability planning efforts at several grantee programs. In some cases, faculty members from the various disciplines serve on the COD and are able to provide feedback and contribute to the project design, thus ensuring interdisciplinary commitment.</li>
            <li>Some grantees are providing SBIRT trainings to health care and social service staff of agencies where their students serve as interns or have their field placements. Some grantees plan to train other personnel (in addition to the field instructors) at those agencies, while some are planning community-based and regional-based trainings.</li>
            <li>Some grantees are using a train-the-trainer model so that training will be self-perpetuating.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>One grantee has no plan for long-term sustainability.</li>
            <li>At one program, only one or two faculty from each discipline have been trained in the SBIRT curriculum, including adjunct faculty.</li>
            <li>One program is providing very few resources to its implementation sites.</li>
            <li>One program has not formed a functional COD.</li>
            <li>Some grantees have sustainability plans for most—but not all—of their component organizations and partners.</li>
            <li>Reimbursement for SBIRT services is a challenge for one grantee, both at its hospital and community-based partners. The grantee reported that reimbursement is a key to sustainability.</li>
            <li>One program’s extensive use of standardized patients is exemplary—yet very expensive.</li>
            <li>Most of one grantee’s faculty members are paid through the SBIRT grant—a practice that could prove problematic when the grant ends.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">GRANTEE EVALUATION</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p><b>Success Factors</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantees’ plans and methodologies for process and outcome evaluation are generally thoughtfully crafted, well developed, well organized, comprehensive, multifaceted, clear, concise, realistic, and based on strong conceptual frameworks and logic models.</li>
            <li>Grantee evaluation teams use a range of vetted tools to assess the overall effectiveness and quality of the training. For example, one grantee uses the CRAFFT, AUDIT, BTST, and FTST. Another has developed four instruments to collect program process and outcome data, including a pretraining questionnaire, a posttest questionnaire, a posttraining questionnaire, and an end-of-semester survey.</li>
            <li>Grantees use evaluation data for ongoing performance improvement efforts.</li>
            <li>Some grantees report high response rates on evaluation and followup. For example, one grantee reported a 94 percent response rate to a pretraining instrument administered at a college site and a 92 percent response rate to a posttraining instrument that included the GPRA baseline satisfaction survey. That same grantee reported that 82 percent of the medical residents at a partner hospital completed the pretraining questionnaire. Another grantee, whose process, outcome, and GPRA data were collected and entered for all trainings through April 21, 2014, had baseline data collection exceeding 90 percent and data collection for followup up to 65 percent.</li>
            <li>Some grantees use additional innovative evaluation tools. At one program, focus groups are convened with social work students and medical residents, trainers, and field instructors to discuss lessons learned to make improvements in subsequent project years. At another program, evaluation staff sit in on live didactic sessions of the SBIRT trainings to assess delivery and provide feedback to instructors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Challenges</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Three university-based grantees have no well-established plans for tracking SBIRT use by training participants after graduation.</li>
            <li>One grantee program finds it challenging to navigate the institutional review board approval process at a partner hospital.</li>
            <li>Some grantees report evaluation methodological shortcomings to measure trainee knowledge and skills and SBIRT proficiency.</li>
            <li>Site coordinators at one program have limited experience in research and evaluation.</li>
            <li>GPRA timeframes have presented a problem for one grantee because the content is woven through the B.S.N. program and integrated into selected APRN courses.</li>
            <li>One grantee lacks a Spanish version of the GPRA satisfaction survey for community workers in Hispanic neighborhoods.</li>
            <li>One grantee has a low response rate for the GPRA 30-day followup.</li>
        </ul>
