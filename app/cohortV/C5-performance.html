    <h3 class="accordion-header">Program Vision and Design</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p> <b>Success Factors:</b> 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>All the States view SBIRT as an essential part of an overarching strategy that supports a public health approach to substance abuse and behavioral health and primary care integration.</li>
            <li>Grantees are committed to reducing health disparities by delivering high-quality SBIRT services to underserved and vulnerable populations.</li>
            <li>Grantees are committed to building a technology infrastructure via integrated health information exchanges.</li>
            <li>Grantees are committed to mobilizing key stakeholder support.</li>
            <li>The grantees’ overall program designs include disseminating sustainable SBIRT programs to other health care entities statewide.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <b>Challenge:</b> 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Behavioral health and primary care services have been historically separate in the States, with limited integration. This separation is perpetuated by beliefs and policies that create challenges to integration.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Leadership</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p> <b>Success Factors:</b> 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantees receive high-level leadership support for their SBIRT programs within their States and payer systems.</li>
            <li>Project management teams are knowledgeable of SBIRT and implementation of evidence-based programs.</li>
            <li>Project team members offer depth of expertise and experience in training, supervision, evaluation, and implementation.</li>
            <li>Project team members are enthusiastic and understand the clinical, systemic, and cultural issues related to SBIRT.</li>
            <li>Project team members are sensitive to the complex cultural, geographic, and economic challenges.</li>
            <li>Grantees have developed medical professional champions who publicly support SBIRT.</li>
            <li>One grantee’s initiative is organized and implemented through key partnerships and builds upon the State’s prior successes with its first SBIRT cooperative agreement awarded in 2011.</li>
            <li>Grantees have formed policy steering committees composed of broad-ranging stakeholders and leaders—including high-level representation from Medicaid, private insurance, health information exchanges, primary care and behavioral health, and others—who are well positioned to support SBIRT deployment and sustainability.</li>
            <li>Grantee evaluation supports leadership decisionmaking.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <b>Challenges:</b> 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The role of county governments in SBIRT dissemination and adoption requires further definition for at least two grantees.</li>
            <li>Some grantees have systems spanning large geographical areas, creating issues of access and care coordination.</li>
            <li>State purchasing processes in some States are lengthy and result in startup delays requiring corrective action to meet grant performance targets.</li>
            <li>Frontline staff need ongoing education and assistance to build their knowledge base and support for SBIRT adoption.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">IMPLEMENTATION PLAN</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p> <b>Success Factors:</b> 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Implementation of SBIRT services appears generally on track for most grantees:
                <ul>
                    <li>One grantee has implemented SBIRT services on time using a staged implementation process. Its practice sites have clearly determined workflow and use a team-based approach.</li>
                    <li>One grantee individualizes implementation workflow across practice sites.</li>
                    <li>One grantee has implemented SBIRT in two sites serving Native American and Hispanic adults.</li>
                    <li>Project implementation for one grantee is a collaborative effort among four large entities, including the State’s substance abuse office and a major health system. Another entity provides comprehensive training, technical assistance, and evaluation services. Yet another partner will develop an interface to facilitate loading data without the need to reenter information in the Services Accountability Improvement System.</ul>
                </li>
                <li>Grantees have engaged essential stakeholders in their projects and have focused effort on champion recruitment and development supporting multiple levels of champions. Practice site staff similarly demonstrate strong buy-in for SBIRT services.</li>
                <li>Implementation approaches demonstrate sensitivity to context and culture of the populations served.</li>
                <li>Project teams are sensitive to comorbidities commonly associated with substance misuse and are implementing screening processes and evidence-based interventions, presenting opportunities for more comprehensive care.</li>
                <li>Grantees provide training and coaching to all practice site staff to build core SBIRT skills.</li>
                <li>Grantees’ implementation approaches are designed to achieve the greatest likelihood of program sustainability.</li>
                <li>One grantee has developed and piloted a specific approach to screening adult marijuana use that reduces the number of false-positive prescreens and appears better aligned to the adult population’s use patterns.</li>
                <li>Grantees are moving toward having electronic health records (EHRs) for all their programs, and preparing for inclusion in their States’ health information exchanges (HIEs).</li>
                <li>One grantee’s SBIRT activities are being integrated into a tablet application that can be uploaded into EHRs. Similarly, another grantee is using a touch screen convertible tablet to collect and report SBIRT information.
                    <li>One grantee is using telehealth for supervision and coaching to support implementation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <b>Challenges:</b> 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Several grantees are behind in their performance targets.</li>
            <li>One grantee is challenged in meeting performance targets because the program lost two community primary care providers scheduled to implement SBIRT services in year 1.</li>
            <li>Another grantee was delayed in its startup.</li>
            <li>Several grantees’ practice sites are in the early implementation phases and are experiencing challenges with workflow, fidelity, staff buy-in, and other common startup issues.</li>
            <li>One grantee has limited community-based substance abuse treatment capacity, with few Spanish-speaking clinicians and long waitlists at certain facilities.</li>
            <li>Grantees face EHR-related challenges:
                <ul>
                    <li>Grantees’ behavioral health providers are at varying levels of health information technology readiness and capacity to use EHRs and participate in their State HIEs. Some sites are just starting to use an EHR, and some are just beginning to participate in the HIE.</li>
                    <li>One organization is converting four EHRs into a single EHR system, consuming its technological and clinical resources to the point where the SBIRT program EHR needs have been given lower priority, delaying SBIRT integration into this new system.</li>
                    <li>Questions regarding SBIRT and other substance-use-related patient data sharing are still being negotiated between single State agencies and State HIEs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Community Linkages, Partners, and Participation</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p> <b>Success Factors:</b> 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantees have engaged with experienced and committed partners who support implementation.</li>
            <li>Grantee partners leverage existing in-State SBIRT capacity and access to treatment services.</li>
            <li>One grantee’s partners include a health system whose State-supported health homes have capacity for care coordination, including treatment planning; another partner coordinates implementation, training, reporting, and evaluation data collection with health care settings; and another offers distance learning products to extend implementation of SBIRT statewide.</li>
            <li>One grantee partners with a university that provides statewide telehealth as a safety net treatment response.</li>
            <li>Grantees describe good working relationships with the primary care associations, behavioral health provider associations, and other essential stakeholders statewide.</li>
            <li>Several grantees have engaged key stakeholders, including Medicaid and other payers, in policy steering committees.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <b>Challenge:</b> 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>One grantee needs to strengthen its access to substance use disorder treatment services.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">CLIENT OUTREACH, RECRUITMENT, AND REFERRAL</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p> <b>Success Factors:</b> 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>All patients currently served by one of the grantees are part of an integrated primary care network.</li>
            <li>Similarly, another grantee has referral relationships in place between all primary care providers and the State-preferred behavioral health provider network.</li>
            <li>One grantee uses patient navigators to support clients referred to treatment. That project also uses health educators to provide full screenings and brief interventions at the practice sites.</li>
            <li>One grantee is delivering population-based screening for depression.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <b>Challenges:</b> 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Two grantees are currently not providing embedded brief treatment at all practice and health care sites.</li>
            <li>Wait lists for specialty treatment at higher levels of care, such as residential treatment, are a concern for three grantees.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Affordable Care Act Readiness</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p> <b>Success Factors:</b> 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantees are engaging essential stakeholders and policymakers, including Medicaid, to participate on policy steering committees and address issues related to the Affordable Care Act.</li>
            <li>States are actively engaged in Medicaid expansion and changes in health care systems associated with the Affordable Care Act.</li>
            <li>Behavioral health and primary care integration is a priority in most grantee States.</li>
            <li>One grantee’s partner health system, which includes multiple hospitals and primary care sites, has initiated organizational efforts supporting behavioral health and primary care integration.</li>
            <li>Nearly all grantees’ primary care sites are using electronic health records (EHRs) and are embedding SBIRT into those EHRs.</li>
            <li>The grantees’ primary care sites are moving toward participating in their State health information exchanges.</li>
            <li>One of the States has been a national leader in adopting health information technology and implementing the Nation’s first State single-payer health insurance system.</li>
            <li>One grantee has adopted innovative use of telehealth technology for clinical services including clinical supervision.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <b>Challenges:</b> 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>While some States have begun efforts to integrate primary care, substance abuse, and mental health services, defined service delivery models remain a work in progress.</li>
            <li>Provider systems involved with grantees will need significant education and technical assistance to prepare for the impending changes associated with the Affordable Care Act implementation and Medicaid and managed care expansion.</li>
            <li>The current capacity and readiness of community behavioral health systems has been identified as a challenge in most States.</li>
            <li>Some treatment providers have made only limited efforts to increase capacity for the use of health information technology.</li>
            <li>Specialty substance abuse treatment provider capacity (including readiness to adopt new business and clinical practices and electronic health records) spans a wide range.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Sustainability Planning</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p> <b>Success Factors:</b> 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>All grantees’ policy steering committees include essential stakeholders who appear motivated, will play an important role supporting long-term SBIRT sustainability, and will address policy and payer issues that affect the development of a viable and sustainable business model.</li>
            <li>Some grantees have initiated many activities in support of a sustained SBIRT program beyond grant funding.</li>
            <li>Medicaid and Medicare codes for screening and brief intervention are active in four States.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <b>Challenges:</b> 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Although SBIRT is identified in one State’s Medicaid plan and Medicaid expansion, that State still has to fully confirm codes, rates, and policies, including access and credentialing.</li>
            <li>Similarly, another State is undergoing a major transformation in health care—including transitioning to a managed Medicaid system. SBIRT rates, staffing requirements, and operational procedures have not yet been fully promulgated.</li>
            <li>In the two States with active Medicaid codes, those codes limit which SBIRT services providers can deliver and under what circumstances, and SBIRT is not part of the federally qualified health center (FQHC) bundled Medicaid rate in one of those States.</li>
            <li>In support of long-term sustainability, practice sites will need to develop viable business practice models for SBIRT within diverse practice settings. This need is particularly important for FQHCs that operate using bundled rates for services.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3 class="accordion-header">Grantee Evaluation</h3>
    <div class="accordion-content">
        <p> <b>Success Factors:</b> 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grantees have engaged highly experienced evaluation teams that have knowledge of the culture and populations served and provide comprehensive formative and outcome evaluation services in support of implementation and activities related to Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) baseline and followup.</li>
            <li>One grantee has created a data protocol manual that guides practices and procedures and provides common forms for data collection.</li>
            <li>Grantees use evaluation findings to support program implementation and quality improvement processes to adjust workflow, procedures, and services as necessary.</li>
            <li>Grantees have created sophisticated Web-based data reporting systems. One program’s evaluator created an innovative “data dashboard” that graphically represents performance data in a way that is easily understandable by broad constituencies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <b>Challenges:</b> 
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>One grantee could have its evaluation team play a more active role in providing the SBIRT management team with actionable performance data to monitor and support implementation and meet performance targets.</li>
            <li>One grantee has practice sites that are employing high-level staff to collect GPRA data—a practice that has often proven challenging in other settings.</li>
        </ul>
